# AI Tooling Usage

## Tools Used
The following AI-assisted tools were used during this project:
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) for code scaffolding, debugging assistance, and documentation guidance
- GitHub Copilot was not used
- No automated code generation tools were used during final model training or evaluation

## How AI Was Used
AI tools were used to:
- Help scaffold initial scripts (EDA, preprocessing pipelines, model training)
- Debug Python errors and resolve library compatibility issues (e.g., CatBoost + sklearn CV)
- Suggest best practices for preventing data leakage
- Assist with structuring documentation and explaining design decisions

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and validated by running the code locally and verifying outputs.

## Academic Integrity
All final code, experiments, evaluations, and written content were authored and validated by the student.
AI tools were used as a support aid only and not as a replacement for understanding or decision-making.

No AI tools were used during assessment submission in a way that violates academic integrity policies.
